# Free Fall Project
## v1.0
The project is meant to calculate the speed and the time of an object which falls from a height given by the user.
#### Files:
The project comes with `main.c` and 3 header files `time.h`, `speed.h` and `choice.h`,  it has also `CMakeLists.txt`, and the `cmake-build-debug` folder which is needed to compile the project if it's not already done.
#### Requirements
This project needs `stdio.h` and `math.h`.
#### Updates
I will try to do a graph of the object's position in function of the time.
